üìù App Overview

MyBank is a prototype mobile banking app built with Flutter. It allows users to log in, view account balances, transfer funds, pay bills, and view transaction history ‚Äî all within a simple and intuitive interface. The app demonstrates key Flutter concepts such as form validation, routing, and stateful UI components.

üöÄ How to Run the App

1. Make sure Flutter is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the project files into a local folder.
3. Open the project in **VS Code** or **Android Studio**.
4. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch dependencies.
5. Launch the app with `flutter run` on an emulator or physical device.

‚ö†Ô∏è Key Challenges & What Was Learned

Routing & Navigation Conflict: Initially, I faced an issue where the app couldn‚Äôt navigate to the Transfer screen due to a naming conflict between two classes.
Solution: I created a supplementary Dart file (`trsf.dart`) and defined the `TransferScreen` class there, eliminating the conflict.
This experience helped me understand how Dart handles class imports and how modular structure helps in resolving naming collisions.
